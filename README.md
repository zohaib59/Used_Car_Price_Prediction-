#  Used Car Price Prediction

This project aims to predict the selling price of used cars using a wide range of regression algorithms and model interpretation tools. 
The pipeline includes outlier handling, feature encoding, cross-validation, and hyperparameter tuning to build an accurate and interpretable model.

Predicting Used Car Prices with Machine Learning

I recently built a regression modeling pipeline to predict used car prices using real-world features like age, fuel type, kilometers driven, and more.

The project explores multiple modelsâ€”from linear to ensemble methods like XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoostâ€”with cross-validated evaluation metrics and SHAP visualizations for interpretability.

# Highlights:
âœ” Outlier detection & removal
âœ” Label encoding & scaling
âœ” GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning
âœ” SHAP beeswarm to explain feature impact

ðŸ“ˆ XGBoost topped the leaderboard with strong RÂ² scores and actionable insights on pricing dynamics.
